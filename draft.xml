Notes

handle
  - node-specific token used to identify an instance of a single provisioning domain's configuration data
      - interface(s)
      - routes
      - addresses
      - DNS servers
      - DHCP(v4/v6) servers
      - any other provisioning domain configuration data

This data generally does not become available to a node in an atomic fashion, and can change over time
(RAs with 6106 that add or replace DNS servers in previous RAs, ...).

Routes and prefixes can come and go and yet all be part of the same provisioning domain.

  - a given provisioning domain MUST NOT be assumed to have the same handle across attaches

  - implementations SHOULD NOT re-use the same handle for the same provisioning domain across
    attaches because: awesome explanation goes here.

System requirements
Systems which support PVD API calls should set the PVD_HANDLE on incoming packets so that applications
can automatically do the right thing.

what to do with process and thread default values on fork/exec

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122 section 3.3.4.2:  Strong/Weak ES model

RFC7556 section 5:
5.1 Name Resolution

A PVD-aware API MUST make it possible for an application to peform
normal name resolution constrained to the name resolution configuration
within a specified PVD.

Ex: extended getaddrinfo with support for a pvd_handle_t argument.

### Presentation notes


## 2
what things do apps need?

- PvD configuration information
    - get config data, get notified of updates
- PvD selection
    - granularity: system default + per process / thread / file descriptor / ...
- socket-level control
    - control routing and address selection
    - automatic PvD "tagging" of incoming traffic not already classified
- DNS resolution:
    - which DNS servers and search path to use
    - correct routing to those DNS servers
    - don't want to query the right DNS server via the wrong network
- useful errors (a la ENONET, ...)

## 4
new things to define

- get PvD configuration data
    - should be extensible
        - struct with #ifdef extra members?
        - separate query for each configuration element of interest (a la getsockopt())?
    - notification of configuration changes
    - figure out how to express PvD <-> interface/scope_id relationship
- set/get process default PvD, thread default PvD
- a simple programmatic way to reference a specific PvD in these calls
    - e.g.: typedef uint64_t pvd_reference_t
    - separate attaches to the same PvD may be assigned different pvd_ref_t values
    - may help for distinguishing implicit PvDs
    - PVD_UNSPECIFIED

## 5
source address and routing selection

- if a PvD has been specified:
    - it is RECOMMENDED that source address selection be restricted to PvD addresses
        - update RFC6274#section-4
- it is important to return errors
    - might have two PvDs active: one IPv4-only and one IPv6-only
        - ENONET, EPROTONOSUPPORT, EADDRNOTAVAIL, EHOSTUNREACH, ...
- destination reachability:
    - userspace libraries often use connect() tricks to obtain source addresses for sorting
    - this MUST use the routing configuration of the desired PvD
- getaddrinfo() and AI_ADDRCONFIG
    - RFC3493#section-6.1 "...shall be returned only if an IPv4/v6 address is configured on the local system..." -> "... within the requested PvD"

some sockets API considerations

- basically the strong host model
    - except that PvD:interfaces is m:n
    - PvD IDs could be thought of as site-local scopes
- requests for a PvD not currently configured should return ENONET
    - other useful errors need to be returned throughout
    - some of this may want to be relaxed for privileged users
- per packet PvD selection? ... maybe, maybe not
    - once a source address has been selected, using it to send traffic via a different PvD is essentially best effort / subject to system-specific policy

sockets API

- setsockopt() / getsockopt()
    - IP_RECVPVD / IPV6_RECVPVD
        - recvmsg() should include indication of PVD to which the packet arrived
    - IP_PVD / IPV6_PVD
        - source address selection and applicable routing table is restricted to the specified PvD
        - if a source address has already been selected from one PvD, transmitting via another PvD is NOT RECOMMENDED (but of course possible)
    - PVD_UNSPECIFIED
        - no PvD explicitly requested
        - also used to clear a process or thread default and revert to system default
    - for PF_INET / PF_INET6 sockets

- socket()
    - if a process-default or thread-default PvD has been set, the returned file descriptor must be "bound" to the PvD
        - i.e. as if setsockopt(SOL_IPV6, IPV6_PVD, ...) had been called
    - otherwise, the file descriptor defaults to PVD_UNSPECIFIED

- bind()
    - if a PvD is specified && address is unspecified, it is RECOMMENDED source address selection be restricted to this PVD
    - else if a PvD is specified && address is not unspecified, EADDRNOTAVAIL might be returned
    - else best effort / system-specific policies apply

- listen()
    - if the file descriptor is already bound to a PvD, only traffic to one of the PvD's addresses should cause the file descriptor to become readable
    - other traffic should receive an ICMP error

- accept()
    - returned file descriptors should be bound to the PvD of:
        - the listening socket, if it was not bound to PVD_UNSPECIFIED
        - the PvD of the destination address on the system

- connect()
    - bind() discussion applies for source address selection
    - EHOSTUNREACH / ENETUNREACH might be returned

sendmsg() / recvmsg() cmsg semantics
- setsockopt() / getsockopt() options apply
    - IP_RECVPVD / IPV6_RECVPV6
    - IP_PVD / IPV6_PVD
- source address selection discussion applies for IP_PVD / IPV6_PVD
    - some combinations just may not work
    - some may require privileges to even attempt

## 7
DNS resolution

- can be implemented with per-PvD DNS server and search path state
- use sockets API changes for reaching specified nameservers
- maybe extend getaddrinfo(..., hints, ...)
    struct addrinfo {
        int ai_flags;
        ...
    #ifdef HAVE_PVD_API
        pvd_reference_t ai_pvd;
    #endif
    };
- what about getnameinfo(), res_query(), and getdnsapi ?

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
RFC 7556 provides all the essential guidance an API designer would need
to support use of PvDs.

This document aims to make some of the implications more concrete by
discussion and example.
      </t>
      <t>
All system functionality that has historically been performed in the context of a single, implicit PvD must be updated to support the same operations on an explicitly requested PvD.
      </t>
      <t>
For backward compatibility for non-PvD-aware applications, there MUST exist a "default PvD", i.e. a PvD within which system functions requiring a PvD are to be performed.
      </t>
      <t>
Such a PvD MAY be a "null" or "empty" PvD: one in which no addresses or routes of any address family are configured and devoid of configuration information of any kind.  A system for which
he default PvD was such a "null" PvD would effectively require all applications to be fully PvD-aware in order to function.
      </t>
      <t>
It is expected that most nodes will use a variety of information and administrative policy to promote one of a number of currently active PvDs to be the default for ease of backward compatibility, and to
promote another active PvD in its place as circumstances change.
      </t>

<!--
Explicit versus Implicit PvDs
- the API used by PvD-aware applications MUST support both implicit and explicit PvDs
- It SHOULD NOT be necessary for a PvD-aware application to distinguish between explicit and implicit PvDs.  Both SHOULD be equally accessible and useful via the same API calls.
- PvD-aware nodes should provide PvD identifiers for implicit PvDs that can be used with out application change in the same ways as explicit PvDs



 -->

    <section anchor="tl_dr" title="TL;DR">
      <t>
<list counter="reqs" hangIndent="4" style="format R%d">
<t>
An API call MUST exist whereby an application can learn the identifiers, or short handles, of all PvDs active on the system at the time.
</t>
<t>
An mPvD API implementation MUST include a mechanism whereby an application can learn of/be notified of: the arrival of new PvDs or the anticipated removal of a PvD.
Actual removal of a PvD can be learned by observing any blocking PvD API operation for errors indicating the loss of the PvD (e.g. a socket read() returning ENONET).
</t>
<t>
API implementations that use short handles to reference PvD information (identifiers, configuration information) SHOULD consider varying the handle used for
a specific PvD with each separate attach, e.g. a 3GPP connection to "apn.carrier.example" might have handle 100 for the first attach after boot,
and 101 for the next attach after going into and coming out of "airplane mode".  Because there is no guarantee that the configuration information, like delegated
prefixes and configured IP addresses, will be the same with every successful attachment to the same PvD, changing the handle accordingly can help
to disabuse application writers of erroneous notions of caching PvD configuration information from one attachment instance to another.
</t>
<t>
There MUST be an API call which, when passed a PvD identifier or short handle, returns elements of configuration information specific to that PvD.
</t>
<t>
This API MUST be extenible, as PvD information is not guaranteed to be learned atomically nor is it guaranteed to be static. Furthermore, this API needs to
be extensible in order to accomodate requesting new configuration information not yet conceived of at this time, e.g. a new FOO protocol is used within a given PvD and
it's important for applications to learn that they need to use the proxy BAR for best performance.
</t>
<t>
An mPvD API implementation MUST include a mechanism whereby an application can learn of changes to the configuration information of a given PvD, e.g. a new temporary
address has been formed, a new secondary DNS server has replaced the previous secondary, et cetera.
</t>
<t>
For every element of system functionality that has historically been performed in the context of a single, implicit PvD an API extension MUST exist allowing the application to specificy that the same functionality be
performed within the scope of an explicitly requested PvD (via identifier or handle).

      <t>
Two major categories of PvD application API requirements:
- learning about PvDs
    - existence and changes in availability
    - configuration data contained within a PvD ID and changes of configuration information
- selection of a PvD to scope various operations:
    - selection of configuration information
    - selection of source addresses
    - selection of routing information

(consistent use)
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7556#section-5.2
      </t>
      <t>
High-level API requirements are:
- it must be possible to learn of pvds coming and going
- it should be possible to learn pvd configuration information and updates
- everything done today with an implicit pvd assumed must be doable with an explicit pvd
      </t>
      <t>
The rest of this document is concerned with:
- identifying new system requirements
- identifying some existing uses of implicit pvds that will need to be updated to support explicit pvds

// Not guaranteed to be stable across across associations to a PVD.
//
// The same PVD may have different pvd_handle_t's if, for example,
// when reattaching later to the same PVD (returning home in the
// evening), the same PVD may be assigned a different pvd_handle_t.
//
// The pvd_handle_t must remain valid until a disconnection or

//
// Applications explicitly specifying PVD indices to PVD-aware

// the system that a given index was valid).  In order to account for
// this, PVD indices SHOULD NOT be recycled, to the extent possible.
// One acceptable implementation approach is to assign every new PVD
// context a strictly monotically increasing index, such that any
// specific index is not reused until the unsigned integer space has
// been completely exhausted, before restarting again from 1.
typedef unsigned int pvd_handle_t;

// The value PVD_HANDLE_UNSPEC is used to indicate no specific PVD.

//     }
//     return_type result = functionname(regular arguments...);
//     pvd_set_thread_default(saved);  // Should error-check
//     return result;
// }

Things thare are missing include:

    - should there be a PVD index defined for "node-local"?
      Regardless, need text about what PVD loopback is in or why it's
      in every PVD or...


    - methods to get attributes of a PVD, like whether it
      is comprised of a mobile link versus wifi/ethernet, whether there
      is some metering/charging associated with traffic sent/received via
      this PVD or not, etc.

The major new security impact of an mPvD API is that it becomes much
simpler (by design) to write a functional application to create a bridging
data path between two PvDs that would not have otherwise been directly
connected.
      </t>
      <t>
For some operating systems, existing APIs already make this bridging
possible, though some functionality like DNS resolution may have been
difficult to implement.  Indeed, the very aim of an mPvD API is to make
implementing a PvD-aware application simple and to make its functioning
more "correct" ("first class" support for such functionality).
      </t>
      <t>
Operating system implementations have several points of potential
policy control including:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
use of certain PvDs MAY be restricted by policy (e.g. only approved users, groups, or individual applications might be granted access), and/or
          </t>
          <t>
use of more than one PvD (or the mPvD API itself) MAY be restricted by policy (e.g. only approved users, groups, or individual applications might be granted access).
          </t>
        </list>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
