Notes

handle
  - node-specific token used to identify an instance of a single provisioning domain's configuration data
      - interface(s)
      - routes
      - addresses
      - DNS servers
      - DHCP(v4/v6) servers
      - any other provisioning domain configuration data

This data generally does not become available to a node in an atomic fashion, and can change over time
(RAs with 6106 that add or replace DNS servers in previous RAs, ...).

Routes and prefixes can come and go and yet all be part of the same provisioning domain.

  - a given provisioning domain MUST NOT be assumed to have the same handle across attaches

  - implementations SHOULD NOT re-use the same handle for the same provisioning domain across
    attaches because: awesome explanation goes here.

System requirements
Systems which support PVD API calls should set the PVD_HANDLE on incoming packets so that applications
can automatically do the right thing.

// Not guaranteed to be stable across across associations to a PVD.
//
// The same PVD may have different pvd_handle_t's if, for example,
// when reattaching later to the same PVD (returning home in the
// evening), the same PVD may be assigned a different pvd_handle_t.
//
// The pvd_handle_t must remain valid until a disconnection or
// disassociation event occurs, after which the pvd_handle_t MUST NOT
// be recycled to refer to a different PVD so long as there remain
// any identifiable references to it (e.g. a process or thread still
// has this PVD index set as its default).
//
// Applications explicitly specifying PVD indices to PVD-aware
// functions are not readily identifiable (indeed an application
// could progressively walk the PVD index space attempting various
// function calls without ever having received any indication from
// the system that a given index was valid).  In order to account for
// this, PVD indices SHOULD NOT be recycled, to the extent possible.
// One acceptable implementation approach is to assign every new PVD
// context a strictly monotically increasing index, such that any
// specific index is not reused until the unsigned integer space has
// been completely exhausted, before restarting again from 1.
typedef unsigned int pvd_handle_t;

// The value PVD_HANDLE_UNSPEC is used to indicate no specific PVD.

// implement support for the Provisioning Domain API, an error, or
// a signal to "clear" previous PVD index state.

// is not explicitly specified.

// Same as above, but operates at a per-process level.  If no
// process-specific default has been set this MUST return the value
// of a call to pvd_current_system_default().
pvd_handle_t pvd_process_default();

// Same as above, but operates at a per-thread level.  If no
// thread-specific default has been set this MUST return the value

// Any function that is not easily extended to support a pvd_handle_t

//         return error_indicator_value;

Things thare are missing include:

    - should there be a PVD index defined for "node-local"?
      Regardless, need text about what PVD loopback is in or why it's
      in every PVD or...


    - methods to get attributes of a PVD, like whether it
      is comprised of a mobile link versus wifi/ethernet, whether there
      is some metering/charging associated with traffic sent/received via
      this PVD or not, etc.


    - method to get a list of all current PVDs.


    - method to map pvd_handle_t's to if_index.

// C.f. if_nameindex()
struct pvd_if_indices {
  pvd_handle_t pvd_index;
