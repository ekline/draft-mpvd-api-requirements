1.  Introduction

   RFC 7556 provides all the essential guidance an API designer would
   need to support use of PvDs.  This document aims to make some of the
   implications more concrete by discussion and example.

   All system functionality that has historically been performed in the
   context of a single, implicit PvD must be updated to support the same
   operations on an explicitly requested PvD.

   For backward compatibility for non-PvD-aware applications, there must
   exist a "default PvD", i.e. a PvD within which system functions
   requiring a PvD are to be performed.

   Such a PvD MAY be a "null" or "empty" PvD: one in which no addresses
   or routes of any address family are configured and devoid of
   configuration information of any kind.  A system for which he default
   PvD was such a "null" PvD would effectively require all applications
   to be fully PvD-aware in order to function.

   It is expected that most nodes will use a variety of information and
   administrative policy to promote one of a number of currently active
   PvDs to be the default for ease of backward compatibility, and to
   promote another active PvD in its place as circumstances change.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  TBD

   Three major categories for PvD API requirements: - selection of
   configuration information - selection of source addresses - selection
   of routing information

   ## 1 PvD . RFC7556 section 2 . "A consistent set of network
   configuration information..." - includes: - participating interfaces
   - addresses - routes (default routes and more specifics) - but also
   RIO -type information - DNS servers and search path - HTTP proxy -
   yet to be specified: metering, medium, captive portal URL, ...  - not
   learned atomically - not static

   High-level API requirements are: - everything done today with an
   implicit pvd assumed must be doable with an explicit pvd - it must be
   possible to learn of pvds coming and going - it should be possible to
   learn pvd configuration information and updates

   The rest of this document is concerned with: - identifying new system
   requirements - identifying some existing uses of implicit pvds that
   will need to be updated to support explicit pvds

3.  TBD2

4.  Host Operating System Requirements

   In order to support the application's use of multiple PVDs, several
   requirements must be fulfilled by the part of the host operating
   system authorized to perform the required functions.

5.  New functionality

6.  Updates to current functionality

   In order to ease porting of non-PVD-aware applications as well as
   support non-PVD-aware applications in accordance with the principal
   of least surprise it is recommended that the following functionality
   be added to existing system networking APIs.

7.  Simple List

   List styles: 'empty', 'symbols', 'letters', 'numbers', 'hanging',
   'format'.

   o  First bullet

   o  Second bullet

   You can write text here as well.

8.  Figures

   Figures should not exceed 69 characters wide to allow for the indent
   of sections.

                 Preamble text - can be omitted or empty.

                         +-----------------------+
                         | Use XML, be Happy :-) |
                         |_______________________|

        Cross-references allowed in pre- and postamble. [min_ref].

                                 Figure 1

   The CDATA means you don't need to escape meta-characters (especially
   < (&lt;) and & (&amp;)) but is not essential.  Figures may also have
   a title attribute but it won't be displayed unless there is also an
   anchor.  White space, both horizontal and vertical, is significant in
   figures even if you don't use CDATA.

9.  Subsections and Tables

9.1.  A Subsection

   By default 3 levels of nesting show in table of contents but that can
   be adjusted with the value of the "tocdepth" processing instruction.

9.2.  Tables

Internet-Draft            MPVD Application API            September 2015


   .. are very similar to figures:

     Tables use ttcol to define column headers and widths.  Every cell
                  then has a "c" element for its content.

                          +----------+----------+
                          | ttcol #1 | ttcol #2 |
                          +----------+----------+
                          |   c #1   |   c #2   |
                          |   c #3   |   c #4   |
                          |   c #5   |   c #6   |
                          +----------+----------+

                      which is a very simple example.

                       Table 1: A Very Simple Table

10.  More about Lists

   Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
   the hangIndent:

   short   With a label shorter than the hangIndent.

   fantastically long label  With a label longer than the hangIndent.

   vspace_trick
           Forces the new item to start on a new line.

   Simulating more than one paragraph in a list item using <vspace>:

   a.  First, a short item.

   b.  Second, a longer list item.

       And something that looks like a separate pararaph..

   Simple indented paragraph using the "empty" style:

      The quick, brown fox jumped over the lazy dog and lived to fool
      many another hunter in the great wood in the west.

10.1.  Numbering Lists across Lists and Sections

   Numbering items continuously although they are in separate <list>
   elements, maybe in separate sections using the "format" style and a
   "counter" variable.

Internet-Draft            MPVD Application API            September 2015


   First list:

   R1  #1

   R2  #2

   R3  #3

   Specify the indent explicitly so that all the items line up nicely.

   Second list:

   R4  #4

   R5  #5

   R6  #6

10.2.  Where the List Numbering Continues

   List continues here.

   Third list:

   R7  #7

   R8  #8

   R9  #9

   R10 #10

   The end of the list.

11.  Example of Code or MIB Module To Be Extracted

   The <artwork> element has a number of extra attributes that can be
   used to substitute a more aesthetically pleasing rendition into HTML
   output while continuing to use the ASCII art version in the text and
   nroff outputs (see the xml2rfc README for details).  It also has a
   "type" attribute.  This is currently ignored except in the case
   'type="abnf"'.  In this case the "artwork" is expected to contain a
   piece of valid Augmented Backus-Naur Format (ABNF) grammar.  This
   will be syntax checked by xml2rfc and any errors will cause a fatal
   error if the "strict" processing instruction is set to "yes".  The
   ABNF will also be colorized in HTML output to highlight the syntactic
   components.  Checking of additional "types" may be provided in future
   versions of xml2rfc.

14.  Acknowledgements

   The core concepts for this approach were developed for the Android
   multinetworking effort by Lorenzo Colitti, Robert Greenwalt, Paul
   Jensen, and Sreeram Ramachandran.

15.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

16.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
